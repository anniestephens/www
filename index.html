    <font> Speaker 1: I’ve made a lot of bad bets as a kid. Things like, can you pick this lock, can you beat this video game. One of the ones I regret most is “can you solve this rubik's cube?” The stakes were high. This is when we were really getting into our commodore machines, and we bet a box of floppy disks. When I made this bet, I thought I could go to the library and really figure out how to solve the cube. But after two hours, maybe three, sitting in the library turning that cube and trying to get it right, I couldn’t figure it out. I put the book down in disgust and realized I was going to lose a box of floppy disks. Then, a dark thought crossed my mind. Perhaps I wasn’t going to lose a box of floppy disks, perhaps I could solve the cube with a more unconventional way. That’s right, I decided I was going to do one of two things: I was going to take my Rubik’s cube apart or I was going to take the stickers off and reapply them. At first glance, I thought the sticker thing might be easier. Then, it occurred to me that maybe they would lose their stickability, and I wouldn’t be able to put them back on. So I went home, got a screwdriver, and started to try to pry the Rubik’s cube apart. Now, since then, I’ve learned how to properly take a Rubik’s cube apart, you sort of give it a quarter turn and then you can pop the pieces off. Back then, I started to just take the cube and jab a screwdriver at the center cube, which I thought was attached to the base. Soon, it wouldn’t be and I pried upward and that centerpiece popped into the air. I had busted my Rubik’s cube in an attempt to score some floppy disks. The real weird thing about this was that I decided not to bring it up to my friends and they didn’t either. So, the bet itself went nowhere, which was often the case with our bets; you take them seriously then people kinda forget about them when something else would happen. But I had a constant reminder of my busted Rubik’s cube. It would be a few years before I was able to pick another one up at a garage sale, and I would work on that one, failing most of the time till I finally figured it out, and now can solve the Rubik’s cube without breaking it or removing the stickers. I don’t know why I’m so fascinated with the Rubik’s cube, but I always have been. Maybe it’s the puzzle. Maybe it's the colors. Maybe it’s the cartoon that I was obsessed with during its brief run, I’m not sure. But on today’s show, we’re going to talk about the cartoon Rubik: The Amazing Cube. We’ll talk about the people behind the camera. The people doing the voices, the plot, the shows all to brief run, the theme song, and where you can find Rubik: The Amazing Cube today. We have an info packed episode ahead of us. So, without further ado, let’s start the show. ( techno sounds and music playing ). Rubik the Amazing Cube ran from September of 1983 to September of 1984, and it was produced by Ruby Spears. It was on TV as part of the Pacman-Rubik: The Amazing Cube hour on ABC. Ruby Spears, the creators of the show, is a California based production company that specializes in animation. It was founded in 1977 by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears; they had both started out as sound editors at Hanna-Barbera, writing stories on shows like The Herculoids and Space Ghost. In the late 60s, they were tasked with developing a cartoon for Saturday morning that was mystery based. The end result would be the iconic Scooby Doo, Where Are You. Eventually, they would depart from Hanna-Barbera, and would create the Ruby Spears studio. A year later, it was purchased by Filmways television, and in 1981 it was sold to Taft Broadcasting and became a sister company to Hanna-Barbera, which brings everything back together. Other characters and shows that Ruby Spears would create include Fang Face, Plastic Man, the 80s version of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Bundard the Barbarian. Later stuff included the Superman series and the Megaman cartoon series.</font>
